(ns vetops.render-html
  "Build-time HTML renderer for `docs/samples/operator-console.html`.

  Closes flagship checklist item 2 (com-junkawasaki/root ADR-2607189300,
  Wave5 rollout), the same pattern `hospitalops.render-html` (ISIC-861)
  established: this namespace drives the REAL actor stack
  (`vetops.operation` -> `vetops.governor` -> `vetops.store`) through a
  scenario built from the actor's OWN seeded demo data
  (`vetops.store/seed-db`, resources exam-1/kennel-12/exam-3) and
  renders the result deterministically -- no invented numbers, no
  timestamps in the page content, byte-identical across reruns against
  the same seed (verified by diffing two consecutive runs before
  shipping).

  Usage: `clojure -M:dev:render-html [out-file]`
  (default `docs/samples/operator-console.html`)."

(defn run-demo!
  "Runs a fresh seeded store through a scenario mixing every disposition
  this actor can reach, using ONLY real resource ids from
  `vetops.store/demo-data`:

  exam-1 and kennel-12 (both registered AND verified) each clear a
  clean administrative-coordination proposal that auto-commits at
  phase 3 (`:coordinate-appointment-scheduling` for exam-1,
  `:coordinate-boarding-assignment` and `:schedule-staff-shift-
  proposal` for kennel-12 -- all four ops are phase-3 auto-eligible
  per `vetops.phase`). exam-1's `:flag-safety-concern` ALWAYS
  escalates (per `vetops.governor/always-escalate-ops`, regardless of
  confidence or phase) and is approved by a human practice manager.

  Then four HARD-hold rows, none of which ever reach a human (a human
  approver cannot override a HARD violation), covering three distinct
  real governor rules:
    - exam-3 (registered but NOT `:verified?` in the seed data):
      `:coordinate-appointment-scheduling` HARD-holds on
      `:resource-unverified` -- never re-derived from the proposal's
      own claim, only from the resource's own store record.
    - exam-1, advisor deliberately drifts into clinical-scope content
      (`:out-of-scope? true`, the same governor-contract test hook
      `vetops.advisor/infer` documents): HARD-holds on
      `:scope-excluded`.
    - kennel-12, `:coordinate-boarding-assignment` via a wrapped
      advisor that forces `:effect :commit` on an otherwise-clean
      proposal (the same technique `vetops.sim`'s own `t9` case uses
      to exercise this exact governor rule): HARD-holds on
      `:effect-not-propose` -- independent proof the governor never
      trusts an advisor's own `:effect` claim.
    - exam-1, `:coordinate-supply-request` with an ordinary clean
      patch: auto-commits cleanly. Unlike a prior repo in this
      cluster (see `hospitalops.render-html`'s own docstring), this
      actor's `propose-supply-request` rationale text was written from
      the start to describe what IS being requested (bedding/
      cleaning/reception supplies) without repeating any of
      `vetops.governor/scope-excluded-terms`'s own banned substrings
      in a negation clause -- confirmed by running the actor directly,
      not assumed.

  Returns the resulting store -- every field `render` below reads is
  real governor/store output, not a hand-typed copy."
