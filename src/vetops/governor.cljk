  "VetOpsGovernor -- the independent compliance layer for ISIC-750
  veterinary activities operations coordination. The advisor has no
  notion of whether a resource is actually registered and verified,
  whether its own proposed `:effect` secretly claims a direct
  actuation instead of a mere proposal, or whether it has silently
  drifted into a permanently out-of-scope decision area, so this MUST
  be a separate system able to *reject* a proposal and fall back to
  HOLD.

  This actor's scope is deliberately narrow -- ADMINISTRATIVE/FACILITY
  COORDINATION ONLY (exam-room/appointment-slot scheduling, kennel/
  boarding-run assignment logistics, non-clinical consumable supply
  coordination, staff shift proposals, facility safety-concern
  flagging). It NEVER performs or authorizes:
    - diagnosis, clinical assessment, or treatment/care-plan decisions
    - medication, vaccine, or anesthetic administration or dosing
    - surgical or dental procedures
    - euthanasia decisions
    - controlled-substance handling
    - veterinarian-license/compliance-enforcement actions
    - any clinical-authority overrides

  A veterinary practice is inherently a clinical setting for its
  patients, so scope exclusions are MAXIMALLY CONSERVATIVE -- any
  clinical/animal-care content whatsoever (even phrased as a \"safety
  concern\") is a HARD block.

  Three HARD checks, ALL permanent, un-overridable by any human
  approval:

    1. Resource unverified       -- the target exam-room/kennel/bay
                                   resource record must exist AND be
                                   independently confirmed
                                   `:registered?`/`:verified?` in the
                                   store before ANY proposal for it may
                                   commit or even escalate. Never
                                   trusts a proposal's own claim about
                                   the resource -- re-derived from the
                                   resource's own store record, the
                                   same 'ground truth, not self-report'
                                   discipline every sibling actor's
                                   governor uses.
    2. Effect not :propose      -- every proposal's `:effect` MUST be
                                   `:propose`. Any other effect value
                                   is, by construction, a claim to
                                   directly actuate/commit outside
                                   governance -- HARD block, not merely
                                   low-confidence.
    3. Scope exclusion          -- ANY proposal (regardless of op)
                                   whose op, rationale, summary,
                                   citations or draft value touches
                                   diagnosis/treatment/medication/
                                   vaccine/anesthesia/surgical/
                                   euthanasia/license-enforcement
                                   territory is a HARD, PERMANENT
                                   block. Veterinary practices are
                                   clinically central for their animal
                                   patients, so MAXIMALLY-CONSERVATIVE
                                   scope exclusions apply.

  One ESCALATE (SOFT) gate: LLM confidence below the floor, OR the op
  is `:flag-safety-concern` -- ALWAYS escalates to a human, regardless
  of confidence, regardless of how clean the proposal otherwise is.
  `vetops.phase` independently agrees: `:flag-safety-concern` is never
  a member of any phase's `:auto` set either -- two layers, not one."
